  In general: when you apply the coding convention (the "CC" file) to your code,
and all the tests continue working flawlessly, you're good to go.

  How you publish your code/patch is up to you: due credit shall be given one
way or another. The primary goal of this re-make is to create a game that can be
patched when needed. I will gladly delete it the moment the big AAA publish the
original source.


  At some point, corrupted/ambiguous maps and game data will become useful: on
the robustness pass; so crafting/finding those would help too.
