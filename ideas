<> the VFS are plug-ins e.g. you can import resources from wherever you like
   pros:
    * decouple them completely if you like
    * use custom graphics/sound/etc. "mods" w/o any relation to my code
    * use more efficient storage for the game data (you have no right to
      distribute the original game data in any form of course)
   cons:
    * additional work: design the plugin interface; c/c++ ABI fun; this will
      raise complexity
