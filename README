This is a remake of the game engine of the well-known computer game
"Heroes of Might and Magic III" and its official expansions.

I'm not affiliated in any way with the authors/owners/etc. of the original
game, so re-making the AI for example will be purely observation-based and
experience-based.

This remake is being made for fun and education. This remake does not, and will
not provide any of the original game assets, so you need to buy the original
game prior being able to play it by using this remake.
